# Data structures and Algorithms project
Data structures and algorithms lays the foundation for software engineer.
This project is created with aim to have all data structures and algorithms implementation.

# Programming language: C++

  * **Binary Search**
  * **Ternary Search**
  * **Interpolation Search**
* **Sorting Techniques**
  * **Bubble Sort**
  * **Insertion Sort**
  * **Selection Sort**
  * **Merge Sort**
  * **Quick Sort**
  * **Shell Sort**
  * **Radix Sort**
  * **Bucket Sort**
  * **Counting Sort**
  * **Heap Sort (under Heap directory)**
  * **Topological Sort (under Graph directory)**
* **Stack**
* **Queues**
* **Linked Lists (Single/Double)**
* **Union Find**
* **Graph algorithms**
* **Trees**
  * **Binary Search Tree**
  * **AVL Tree**
  * **Red Black Tree**
  * **B Tree**
  * **B+ Tree**
